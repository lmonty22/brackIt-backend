# BrackIt - BackEnd

## Summary

This is a tournament bracket generater designed to allow users to login and generate a bracket to share with their friends. Users create BrackIts with 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 teams. You may make tournaments private or public. Shuffle teams to make first round matchups random, or manually decide first round match ups when you enter your team names. You may record scores, advance teams and edit team names throughout the Torurnament and finally crown a champion. 

Additional features allow you to search for tournaments (that are public) and follow tournaments.
